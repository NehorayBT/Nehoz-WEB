            “Enzo Agada” is a grassroots arts festival held annually in Netanya,
            Israel. It turns everyday spaces—homes, courtyards, and local
            streets—into live venues for music, theater, and workshops, all led
            by local artists and residents. The goal is to build community
            through creativity and accessible culture. As part of the project, I
            designed the event’s visual identity—including fliers, a printed
            planner, and large-scale signage—ensuring a cohesive and inviting
            aesthetic that reflected the festival’s inclusive and artistic
            spirit.
